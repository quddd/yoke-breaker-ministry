people go about daily performing their day to day tasks in a\r\n              never-ending cycle of defeats without seeing the end. Writing THE\r\n              POWER OF THE YOKES is not a sign of the end of my struggles or a\r\n              new beginning. A ring has no beginning or and end. A ring has\r\n              endless positions. My life is a ring in God’s hands. There are an\r\n              endless amount of moments. This is just a moment in the valley of\r\n              coll water and green pastures where God is replenishing my soul.\r\n              While I am experiencing this moment, I will not be ignorant of the\r\n              fact that God is preparing for a long steep climb. THE POWER OF\r\n              THE YOKES is not a mountain top experience. This accomplishment\r\n              opened my eyes to the reality that while it is ambitious to set\r\n              your goals to reach the mountain top, it is better being a piece\r\n              of clay in the potter's hand while you are in the valley. When you\r\n              are at the mountain top of life, it can be a very lonely dangerous\r\n              place to be. Being on mountain top zaps your energy and you are\r\n              constantly in danger of a fatal fall. The valley is where God\r\n              replenishes your soul and gives you the strength for the journey.\r\n              The valley is the place where God breaks you, shape you, and mold\r\n              you. A piece of clay has no knowledge of what the potter will\r\n              create out of it! While God was taking me on this journey I\r\n              eventually come to realize that either I hate or enjoy the\r\n              process! THE POWER OF THE YOKES allows me to be yoke to God and in\r\n              so doing He was able to accomplish the impossible in my life. He\r\n              made of my life a vessel unto honor.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <Image src={Authorpic} alt=\" Carlton Foster\" rounded />\r\n            <h3> Pastor Carlton Foster</h3>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"about-accomplish\">\r\n          <h3>What do I hope this book will Accomplish?</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            My desire for everyone who reads THE POWER OF THE YOKES is to leave\r\n            no stones un-turn. Leave nothing to chance. See your true potential.\r\n            My desire is for everyone to realize that their lives have a purpose\r\n            God is writing their story. You will be yoke to something. Make that\r\n            something to be God. Break free from the negativity of man’s words.\r\n            You are who God says you are. Be sensitive to the voices that you\r\n            are hearing. When you lose your sensitivity, you will listen to the\r\n            wrong voice. You are not racing against the clock to find your\r\n            purpose, leading you to fulfill your destiny. Your life struggles do\r\n            not define you. What defines you is what you do with the moment that\r\n            God presents to you. This is your moment; seize it! You are not like\r\n            anyone else. That is why you need to break free from the yoke. Your\r\n            yoke is not servitude. It is only a symbol of servitude. THE POWER\r\n            OF THE YOKES will help you to identify potential yokes or yokes in\r\n            your life. You have the power to break free from the yoke. It was\r\n            always inside of you. This will be the moment when you realize that\r\n            it was always inside of you to achieve greatness.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About;\r\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nclass Contact extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      name: \"\",\n      email: \"\",\n      message: \"\"\n    };\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"Contact\">\n        <h3>Leave a comment or question</h3>\n        <form\n          id=\"contact-form\"\n          onSubmit={this.handleSubmit.bind(this)}\n          method=\"POST\"\n        >\n          <div className=\"form-group\">\n            <label htmlFor=\"name\">Name</label>\n            <input\n              type=\"text\"\n              className=\"form-control\"\n              value={this.state.name}\n              onChange={this.onNameChange.bind(this)}\n            />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"form-group\">\n            <label htmlFor=\"exampleInputEmail1\">Email address</label>\n            <input\n              type=\"email\"\n              className=\"form-control\"\n              aria-describedby=\"emailHelp\"\n              value={this.state.email}\n              onChange={this.onEmailChange.bind(this)}\n            />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"form-group\">\n            <label htmlFor=\"message\">Message</label>\n            <textarea\n              className=\"form-control\"\n              rows=\"5\"\n              value={this.state.message}\n              onChange={this.onMessageChange.bind(this)}\n            />\n          </div>\n          <button type=\"submit\" className=\"btn btn-primary\">\n            Submit\n          </button>\n        </form>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n\n  onNameChange(event) {\n    this.setState({ name: event.target.value });\n  }\n\n  onEmailChange(event) {\n    this.setState({ email: event.target.value });\n  }\n\n  onMessageChange(event) {\n    this.setState({ message: event.target.value });\n  }\n\n  handleSubmit(event) {}\n}\n\nexport default Contact;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"./App.css\";\nimport Menu from \"./menu.js\";\nimport Home from \"./home.js\";\nimport About from \"./about.js\";\nimport Contact from \"./contact.js\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <Menu></Menu>\n      <Home></Home>\n      <About></About>\n      <Contact></Contact>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
